This directory contains the html installation scripts which create a web site 
for a given data source (suffix).  Before installing, make sure the web server
resources in the ../../parm/RadMon_config file are set correctly.  Those definitions
will be used to build the radiance web site.

The transfer mechanism is a password-free, secure log-in using a public/private 
encryption key pair.  There is information on the bottom of the wiki page about 
how to set that up (see https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/gsi/wiki/RadianceMonitorPackage).

The install script requires one parameter:  the data suffix (identifier).  The suffix
is used to access the corresponding entry in the ../../parm/data_map.xml file.
An example calling sequence is thus:

>  Install_html.sh newd
