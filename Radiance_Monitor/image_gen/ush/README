Radiance Monitor, image_gen scripts

The scripts in this directory are used to generate images for specified 
data sources using the data files created by the data_extract portion of this
package. 

The scripts named in "camel case" (mixed case) may be called directly.  Those
named entirely in lower case are utility scripts which are used by the 
camel case scripts; they should not be called directly by the user.

There are two sets of scripts; one for the global, and one for the
regional.  They are similar, but not identical in function.  

The top level scripts are CkPlt_glbl.sh and CkPlt_rgnl.sh scripts.  They
poll the ../../parm/data_map file to see if new data has arrived since the 
last plot time (cycle).  If new data is available they run the lower level scripts
to set up the environement, move data and control files into work directories, 
and call the GrADS scripts (located in ../gscripts) to create image files.  The
image files are then sent to the specified web server by scp.  See the 
../parm/plot_rad_conf file for web server settings. 

There is also a CkPlt_comp.sh script which can do comparison plots between 2 or 3
data sources.  The sources must be of the same type (global or regional).  See the
../parm/plot_comp_config file for details on setting up the comparison plots.
