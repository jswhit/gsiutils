Radiance Monitor, image_gen scripts

The scripts in this directory are used to generate images for specified 
data sources using the data files created by the data_extract portion of this
package. 

The scripts named in "camel case" (mixed case) may be called directly.  Those
named entirely in lower case are utility scripts which are used by the 
camel case scripts; they should not be called directly by the user.

There are two sets of scripts; one for the global, and one for the
regional.  They are similar, but not identical in function.  

The top level scripts are CkPlt_glbl.sh and CkPlt_rgnl.sh scripts.  They
poll the ../../parm/data_map file to see if new data has arrived since the 
last plot time (cycle).  If new data is available they run the lower level scripts
to set up the environement, move data and control files into work directories, 
and call the GrADS scripts (located in ../gscripts) to create image files.  The
image files are then sent to the specified web server by scp.  See the 
../parm/plot_rad_conf file for web server settings. 

There is also a CkPlt_comp.sh script which can do comparison plots between 2 or 3
data sources.  The sources must be of the same type (global or regional).  See the
../parm/plot_comp_config file for details on setting up the comparison plots.

FILE TRANSFERS:  
==== =========

Previous versions of this package used secure copy (scp) to push image files to 
the web server.  The scp command has enough overhead though that the large number
of transfers that the package performs can slow the web server.  To prevent server
slowdowns rsync is now used instead of scp in the plot_angle, plot_bcor, plot_bcoef,
plot_horiz, plot_time, and plot_summary scripts.

Instead of pushing files the plot_* scripts now copy the image files to the $IMGNDIR 
directory.  The default location for this is ~/nbns/imgn/$SUFFIX (SUFFIX is the data
source identifier, such as pr4ed), and it has subdirectories for angle, bcoef, bcor, 
horiz, summary, and time.  This is the same structure of the pngs directory on the 
web server.  The rsync utility can then be used to mirror the files in the $IMGNDIR 
to the web server's pngs directory.  

The Transfer.sh script can be used to accomplish the rsync mirroring.  It may be run
as a cron or from the command line, and takes the SUFFIX as it's only argument.  Whe 
run it will copy any files in $IMGNDIR that are newer than the web server's versions.  
If there are no differences between the files in $IMGNDIR and the web server then no
file transfers are made.  This is an example of a cron entry to run Transfer.sh once
an hour at 20 minutes after the hour (HH:20:00).
