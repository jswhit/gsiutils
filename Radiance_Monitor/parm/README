The RadMon package can be configured for your particular data source by 
modifying the RadMon_user_settings script in this directory, or by overriding
specific entries in that script within your interactive shell.  

If you have not don so, run the RadMon_install.sh script located in the 
directory one level from here.  RadMon_install.sh will update the 
RadMon_config and RadMon_user_settings files and set some defaults based 
on the system you're running on (ccs, wcoss or zeus). 

Next, edit or override specific values in the RadMon_user_settings script as
necessary.  For example, the default $RADSTAT_LOCATION, or directory which
contains the *.radstat files you want to process, is set by default to 
/com/gfs/prod.  You may edit this location in the file to anything you want 
or set a value for $RADSTAT_LOCATION in your shell.  The values of any 
variables in RadMon_user_settings will be overriden by the same variables 
declared in your interactive shell.  To override the RADSTAT_LOCATION the
the command is generally:

> export RADSTAT_LOCATION=/my/directory/not/the/default


Depending on which interactive shell you are using the command might be 
slightly different.  The above example works on csh and bash.
