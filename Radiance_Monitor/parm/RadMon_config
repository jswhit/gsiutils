#
# MY_GSI should point to your working directory which contains the 
# copied or checked out instance of the GSI.
#
  export MY_GSI=/global/save/${USER}/safford_radmon

#
#  The MY_TANKDIR will be the location for the extracted data files and
#  the control files used for image plotting.  This is the base definition 
#  and the succedding scripts will construct and use subdirectories under
#  this location.
#
  export MY_TANKDIR=/u/${USER}/nbns

#
#  USER_CLASS is the class which is used for job submissions.  It has
#  defaults, which are based on the specified RUN_ENVIR in the data_map
#  table.  Prod runs as prod, both para and dev run as class dev by 
#  default.  If you need to override those defaults, to run as devonprod
#  for example, then uncomment USER_CLASS below and set it as needed.
# 
#  export USER_CLASS=""

#  
#  ACOUNT is the account under which job summissions will be run.  It has
#  defaults, global data sources use GDAS-MTN, and regional sources use
#  RDAS-MTN.  If you need to run as a different account then uncomment
#  and edit the ACOUNT variable below.
#
#  export ACOUNT=""
