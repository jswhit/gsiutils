#
#  ACCOUNT is set by the RadMon_instal.sh script, to GDAS-MTN, dev, or ada
#    according to platform (ccs, wcoss, zeus respectively)
#
export ACCOUNT=${ACCOUNT:-ada}

#
#  USER_CLASS is set to "dev" on the CCS, empty on all other platforms
#


#
#  RAD_AREA is either glb (global) or rgn (regional)
#
export RAD_AREA=${RAD_AREA:-glb}

#
#  RADSTAT_LOCATION is location of the radstat files.  If RadMon runs as a 
#    job in a parallel then $COMOUT is used instead of the value defined below.  
#    When plotting, if horizontal plots are desired then RADSTAT_LOCATION will
#    need to be set to the directory of the radstat files (we only extract 
#    horizontal data when it's needed rather than storing huge files all the time).
#
#export RADSTAT_LOCATION=${RADSTAT_LOCATION:-/com/gfs/prod}
export RADSTAT_LOCATION=${RADSTAT_LOCATION:-/scratch1/portfolios/NCEPDEV/da/noscrub/George.Gayno/prcntl}

#
#  USE_ANL switches on/off data extraction for analysis files (ges is always on)
#    0 = off, 1 = on
#
export USE_ANL=${USE_ANL:-0}

#
#  PLOT_ALL_REGIONS switches on/off plotting of all 5 regions (global, land, 
#    water, ice/snow, mixed).   0 = off, 1 = on
#
export PLOT_ALL_REGIONS=${PLOT_ALL_REGIONS:-1}

#
#  PLOT_SUB_AVGS switches on/off plotting of subset averages in certain plots,
#    such as the 7 day avgs in the summary plots.  0 = off, 1 = on
export PLOT_SUB_AVGS=${PLOT_SUB_AVGS:-1}

#
#  DO_ARCHIVE switches on archiving of extracted data files.  This is generally
#    used for the operational data sets (GDAS, NDAS) and isn't normally necessary
#    for parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export DO_ARCHIVE=${DO_ARCHIVE:-0}

#
#  HPSS_DIR is the location for archived data on the hpss.  It will only
#    be used if DO_ARCHIVE is set to on (1).
export HPSS_DIR=${HPSS_DIR:-/NCEPDEV/hpssuser/g01/Edward.Safford/nbns/stats}

#
#  STATIC_SATYPE switches on/off use of static satype list.  This is primarily
#    intended for use with diagnotic file error reporting and isn't needed 
#    for most parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export STATIC_SATYPE=${STATIC_SATYPE:-0}

#
#  DO_DIAG_RPT switches on/off the diagnostic error reporting.  This is check
#    primarily intended for use with the operational data sets (GDAS,NDAS) where
#    detection and reporting of a missing sat/instrument source in a given cycle run
#    is desirable.  It is not normally necessary in parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
export DO_DIAG_RPT=${DO_DIAG_RPT:-0}

#  DO_DATA_RPT switches on/off error checking and reporting of the penalty values
#    by channel for each sat/instrument source.  This is a check primarily intended
#    for use iwth the operational data sets (GDAS,NDAS) where detection and 
#    reporting of drifting channel(s) on specific sat/instrument sources is 
#    desirable.  It is not normally necesary to apply this to parallels.  0 = off, 1 = on
