#
# The data_map file contains information about all available data sources.
#
# All information is accessed by suffix.  This should be a unique identifier.
#   NOTE:  the suffix should be preceeded by at least one blank space (" ").  
#          The script that updates the processing dates uses an initial space
#          before the suffix in order to distinguish between a suffix that is 
#          entirely a subset of another (i.e. " tmp" won't match " ptmp", but
#          "tmp" matches "ptmp"). 
#   Area indicates global or regional.  
#   File location indicates the directory which contains the radstat files.  If
#     running as a parallel, the $COMOUT location will override this entry.  
#   Anl flag indicates if analysis files should be processed. 
#   Prodate indicates the last cycle that was processed by the data_extract 
#     scripts.
#   Imgdate indicates the last cycle for which images were produced.  This will be the
#     last cycle shown on a time-series plot.  It must be less (meaning an earlier
#     cycle) than the prodate cycle, or no plotting will occur.
#   Static_SATYPE indicates the source for SATYPE.  
#     0 = derive the SATYPE list dynamically from the contents of the radstat file 
#         and (for image gen) from the list of files in $TANKDIR/$SUFFIX. 
#     1 = use SATYPE.txt file in the $TANKDIR/$SUFFIX
