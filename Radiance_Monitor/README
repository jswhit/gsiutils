README RadMon package 

The RadMon (radiance monitoring) package can be used to extract certain information
from radiance diagnostic files and visualize the results by plotting the data using
GrADS.  The package also may optionally perform data validation and error checking
and report problems using email.

The package is organized in two main pieces, the data_extract and image_gen.  There
is also an nwprod directory, which contains the major components of the 
data_extract portion.  (Part of the data extract has been submitted to OPS for 
so that it may run as part of each cycle.  This was a subset of what is now in the 
nwprod directory, which reflects the required opporational organization.)  

There is also a parm directory containing configuration files used by the entire 
package.  The data_extract and image_gen directories also have parm diretories,
containing configuration files specific to the data extraction and image generation
functions.

In order to get the package running you must peform these steps:


1.  Run the makeall.sh script.  This script may be used to make all the executables 
in the package and place them in the correct exec directories.  It may be run with 
a "clean" parameter which performs a make clean on all source code directories.

2.  Go to the RadMon/parms directory and modify the RadMon_config and data_map.xml files.  
Please see the README file in that directory for instructions.

3.  Run the data extraction to create the binary data files.  This can be done any time 
after the diagnostic file is created.  There are two ways to run the data extraction.  
In RadMon/data_extract/ush/ there are two scripts named VrfyRad_glbl.sh and 
VrfyRad_rgnl.sh.  These can be run from a cron or command line.  They function by 
setting up the environment variables to run RadMon/nwprod/jobs/JGDAS_VRFYRAD.sms.prod.

Alternately the JGDAS_VRFYRAD.sms.prod job can be included in the vrfy.sh step in your 
parallel.

4.  Go to the RadMon/image_gen/html directory and run install_html.sh.  This will build
the web site using the web settings specified in step 2, and the available 
satellite/instrument sources from step 3.

5.  Run the image generation.  This can be done after the binary files are created.  In
RadMon/image_gen/ush there are two scripts, CkPlt_glbl.sh and CkPlt_rgnl.sh.  These can
be run from the command line or as a cron.  They create the images using GrADS and 
push them to the web server.
