Radiance Monitor, data_extract scripts


The scripts in this directory are used to set up the environments, run the 
appropriate executables, and move the resulting data and log files to the 
desired directories.

The scripts named in "camel case" (mixed case) may be called directly.  Those
named entirely in lower case are utility scripts which are used by the 
camel case scripts; they should not be called directly by the user.

There are two sets of scripts; one for the global, and one for the
regional.  They are similar, but not identical in function.  

The top level scripts are VrfyRad_glbl.sh and VrfyRad_rgnl.sh scripts.
They poll for new diagnostic files and, if a new diag file is found, they 
submit ../nwprod/jobs/JGDAS_VRFYRAD.sms.prod to peform the data extraction 
and optional data validation.  

The VrfyRad_*.sh scripts take 2 parameters as input:  the desired suffix, and
the running environment ("dev", "para", or "prod", though "prod" should only
be used in the production environment).  Suffix is the identifier for a data
source, typically an experiment name from a parallel (i.e.  es_pri, nrx, etc.).
Each suffix used should have an entry in the ../../parms/data_map file.  

The resulting data files are saved in $TANKDIR/${SUFFIX} and 
$TANKDIR/regional/${SUFFIX} directories.   $TANKDIR is defined within the 
*_conf files in the parm directory. 

The RunVrfy.sh script may be used as a batch processor.  It can be used 
to process data for a given suffix (source) in 3 ways:
  1.  Between explicit starting and ending dates.
  2.  From a specified starting date until it runs out of data.
  3.  From the last date processed in the ../../parm/data_map file 
      until it runs out of data. 
The calling sequence is > RunVrfy.sh suffix [start date] [end date].
The suffix must match an entry in the ../../parm/data_map file.

The MkBase.sh script is used to create the base history files which are
used by the data validation reports.  If you do not wish to turn on data error
reporting (generally only needed for operational data, not experimental
parallels), then this script won't need to be run.

The MkCtl_glbl.sh and MkCtl_rgnl.sh scripts are utility scripts that 
generate the control files for a given suffix (source).  The control files
are created by default during normal data extraction, and the are used to
by the image generation scripts. Unless you wish to modify the defaults, 
these scripts won't need to be run.

See the README in the parms directory for default settings information.
