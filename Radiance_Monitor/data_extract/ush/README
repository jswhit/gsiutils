Radiance Monitor, data_extract scripts


The scripts in this directory are used to set up the environments, run the 
appropriate executables, and move the resulting data and log files to the 
desired directories.

There are two sets of scripts; one for the global, and one for the
regional.  They are similar, but not identical in functioning.  

The top level scripts are VrfyRad_glbl.sh and VrfyRad_rgnl.sh scripts.
They poll for new diagnostic files and calls the lower level data 
extraction scripts if a new diag file is found. 

VrfyRad_glbl.sh takes 2 parameters as input:  the desired suffix, and the 
running environment ("dev", "para", or "prod").

The resulting data files are saved in $TANKDIR/${SUFFIX} and 
$TANKDIR/regional/${SUFFIX} directories.   $TANKDIR is defined within the 
*_conf files in the parm directory.

See the README in the parms directory for default settings information.
