There are four executables, angle_bias.glb.x, bcoef.glb.x, bcor.glb.x, 
and time.glb.x.  They can be compiled by entering these commands:

>  make -f makefile.angle_bias 
>  make -f makefile.bcoef
>  make -f makefile.bcor
>  make -f makefile.time

The resulting executables are automatically copied to the exec directory.


These executables extract radiance data and save it to binary files.  The
data is broken down into 5 regions, by surface type.  The regions are:
'global' (which includes all data), 'land', 'water', 'snow and ice', and 
'mixed'.

The output binary files are not compatible with the regional
executables' output files.
