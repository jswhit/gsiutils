There are four executables, angle_bias.rgn.x, bcoef.rgn.x, bcor.rgn.x, 
and time.rgn.x.  They can be compiled by entering these commands:

>  make -f makefile.angle_bias 
>  make -f makefile.bcoef
>  make -f makefile.bcor
>  make -f makefile.time

The resulting executables are automatically copied to the exec directory.


These executables extract radiance data and save it to binary files.  The
data is contained in a single region, roughly western/northern hemisphere.

The output binary files are not compatible with the files produced by 
the global programs.
