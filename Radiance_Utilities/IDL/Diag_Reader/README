Procedures to read diag files directly into IDL structures and to calculate
stats.
===========================================================

read_diags.pro:  Procedure to radiance diag files into IDL structures.

diag_stats.pro:  Calculates simple statstics using structures produced by
                 read_diags.pro

Plot_Observation_Summary.pro:
                 Reads in observations from a specified list of instruments and
                 times and produces summary plots for each instrument as a 
                 function of channel.

Plot_Histogram_2d_ScanAngle.pro:
                 Reads in a series of diag files and produces 2D histograms for
                 a specified range of channels.
